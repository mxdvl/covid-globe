# COVID-19 Data and Three.JS

*Please note this data currently is **not updating***

For current COVID-19 information, refer to trusted news network, such as [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak), the [John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) or [Our World In Data â€“ Coronavirus Disease](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus).

This small project is a proof-of-concept using geolocalised data, and the [three-globe module](https://github.com/vasturiano/three-globe) for Three.JS.

## TODO
- [X] Country to lat-long
- [X] Colour by intensity
- [ ] Set up webpack / actual modules
- [ ] Load data dynamically
- [ ] Maybe find a better scale?
